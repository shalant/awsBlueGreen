# awsBlueGreen

## Built a CI/CD Pipeline using AWS services (EC2, ECS, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, Fargate, S3, RDS, MySQL, Aurora, IAM, etc.) for an online ticketing application that uses a monolith Java platform. A great way for me to work with the command line to build a project. Also uses various technologies such as Docker and JHipster. JHipster auto-generates the monolith platform to use Angular, Gradle, JWT, with a Java backend.
